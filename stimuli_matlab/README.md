## Matlab codes to create the stimuli


Run the .m files in the following order:
- CTFV1_PROCEDURE *tweak settings to change procedure file used for the other codes*
- CTFV1_STIM *this code creates the normalized images from a _01greenback_ folder with images*
- CTFV1_BACK *this code makes the scrambled background images*
- CTFV1_BLEND *and finally the stimuli and backgrounds are blend and saved using this code*

###### It's possible some .bmp files and .mat files should be added to the folder structure to run the codes
