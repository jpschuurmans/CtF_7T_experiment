This folder contains the localizer experiment to test.
One run has a duration of ~= 12min

For everything to work properly:
- don't change or move any files/folders
- to end (break the loop) press Ctrl+C -> your data will be saved anyway 
- you can also press "esc" in stead of a "normal" trial response



Causion: Extremely boring :D (especially very long!)
